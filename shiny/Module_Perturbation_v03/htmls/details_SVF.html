The SVF cells and mature adipocytes from four donors were isolated using a previously described method (van Harmelen et al., 2005 [PMID: 15492368]). Briefly, scWAT was collagenase treated, and SVF and mature fat cells were separated by centrifugation. SVF cells were allowed to adhere to plastic in plating medium containing 10% FBS. To avoid proliferation, cells were kept in plating medium <20 h before inducing differentiation. SVF, unlike hASC cultures, is believed to contain both mesenchymal-like stem cells and committed adipocyte precursor cells. SVF differentiation medium was DMEM/F12 GlutaMax (Gibco #31331-028) supplemented with hydrocortisone (100 nM), insulin (66nM), trnasferrin (10 ug/ml), biotin (33 uM), panthothenate (17 uM), T3 (1 nM), 50 I.U./mL penicillin and 50 Î¼g/mL streptomycin, HEPES (15 mM), fungizone (1.25 ug/ml) for all days and rosiglitazone (10 uM) for the first six days.
