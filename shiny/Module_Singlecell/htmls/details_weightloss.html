From Petrus et al. <br>
CD248 expression was knocked down by RNAi in human in vitro differentiated adipocytes at day 10 of differentiation using 40 nM siRNA oligonucleotides (M-010720-00-0005, Dharmacon) 
and compared with non-silencing control RNAi (D-001206-13-05). The electroporation of siRNA was combined with 1 μg of plasmids containing the hypoxia response element (HRE)
 (previously described in [Forsberg et al., J Endocrinol., 2015]) coupled to a luciferase reporter and 0.1 μg Renilla. Cells were electroporated at day 10 of differentiation as previously described [Petrus et al., JCEM, 2018]
  and were then incubated in a hypoxic chamber at day 12 and harvested for subsequent analysis at day 13. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System 
  (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. <br><br>
  Micro array was performed using Clariom™ S Assay, human (Catalog number: 902926). <br>
  Array data were uploaded to the GEO repository and assigned GEO accession number GSE131667. 
  Supplementary files for “CD248 knockdown in in vitro differentiated adipocytes exposed to hypoxia” 
  were assigned accession numbers GSM3801054-65.<br> <br>
  Note: CD248 knock-down data from this data set can be accessed via the Genetic Perturbation submodule.
