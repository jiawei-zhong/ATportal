The weight loss submodule includes five studies with transcriptome data from abdominal subcutaneous WAT before and after weight loss. Thereof, two studies included subjects with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, which were followed-up two years (Petrus et al.) or two and five years (Kerr et al.) after bariatric surgery. The other four cohorts are dietary intervention studies with low-caloric diets followed up either eight weeks after the diet (Imbert et al., Armenise et al., both part of DioGenes), after five and twelve weeks (Vink et al.) or after fourthween weeks (Johansson et al.). Data is visualized as boxplots with individual, paired data points connected by lines. For more information, please look at the Details and Interpretation tabs.  <br></p>
