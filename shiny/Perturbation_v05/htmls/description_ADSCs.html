This data set allows a detailed look at effects of adipogenesis on transcript levels in adipose tissue derived stem cells. Details on the differentiation are reported under the “Details” section. Data is available for 16 timepoints between induction of adipogenesis and the differentiated state (day 12). Data on the x axis is presented as natural logarithm of the minutes after induction of adipogenesis. Data was generated at Ryden & Mejhert lab.
