This data allows the comparison on in vitro differentiated adipocytes (hMADS) cultured under hypoxic (1% O2) and normoxic (18.6% O2) conditions for 24 hours. Data is available for three replicates in each condition obtained from Clariom S microarray sequencing.
For more information, please see the 'Details' tab. Outputs currently include heatmaps, volcano plots and summary table for one or multiple genes. More information on processing and interpretation can be found under the 'Interpretation' tab.
