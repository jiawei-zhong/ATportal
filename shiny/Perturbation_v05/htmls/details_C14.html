  From Kerr et al. <br>
  hMSCs were isolated from abdominal subcutaneous WAT from a male donor (16 years old, BMI 24 kg/m2). hMSCs were cultured in 24 (1 x 105 cells/well) or 48-well (5 × 104 cells/well) plates and differentiated into adipocytes using described protocols [27]. For gene knockdown at day -1, hMSCs were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting a candidate gene (Dharmacon™ OnTarget plus SMART pool or Dharmacon™ siGENOME SMART pool, VWR International, Sweden) or negative control siRNA (siNC) (Dharmacon™ siGENOME Control Pool) using DharmaFECT™ 3 transfection reagent (VWR International) as per manufacturer's instructions. For transfection at day 8 a Neon™ transfection system (MPK5000, Invitrogen, Göteborg, Sweden) was used as per manufacturer's instructions. Details of siRNAs used are given in Appendix B, Supplemental Table 1.
