  From Balliu et al. <br>
  Experiments were conducted with human skeletal muscle [Rokach et al., Biochem. J., 2013 and Carcamo-Orive, PLoS Comput. Biol., 2020] (HMCL-7304 myocytes; provided by Institute of Child Health, University College London),
   fat [Fischer-Posovszky et al., Obes. Facts, 2008] (terminally differentiated Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome [SGBS] pre-adipocytes; provided by Dr. Martin Wabitsch, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany), 
   and liver [Aden et al., Nature, 2008] (HepG2; ATCC) cell lines. SGBS and HMCL-7304 cells were differentiated as described previously.[Carcamo-Orive, PLoS Comput. Biol., 2020 and Fischer-Posovszky et al., Obes. Facts, 2008] 
   Each cell line was starved for 6 h in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) with no fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HepG2), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 
   (DMEM)/F12 supplemented with pan/bio and penicillin/streptomycin but no FBS (SGBS adipocytes), or HMCL growth medium (PromoCell) without supplements. 
   For the glucose condition DMEM, no glucose medium (Thermo) was used. After starvation and washing with PBS, the cells were exposed for 2 h to one of the 21 perturbations shown in 
   Figure 1A in triplicate for each cell-line-perturbation combination. We selected a stimulation window of 2 h to allow enough time for transcriptional changes to occur and, at the same time, 
   to minimize potential secondary responses that are not direct transcriptional effects of the selected perturbations, as previously assayed for insulin in the liver and skeletal muscle cells from mice. [Batista et al., Cell Rep., 2019]
