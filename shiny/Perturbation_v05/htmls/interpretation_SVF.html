The line chart presents either normalized or mean abundance values (as defined by “Select data type”, default is normalized mean abundance), whereby mean abundance allows to compare expression levels between genes and normalized mean abundance values allow for a relative comparison in changes across adipocyte differentiation. The x axis shows the natural logarithm of the collection time points in minutes. The available time points are 4, 8 and 12 days after initiating the differentiation.
Heatmap depicts the same data, but allows additional clustering as defined under “Customization”, and plotted values can be found in Table. Corresponding exemplary images showing the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cells across differentiation are shown in Details.
