    Adipose tissue in vivo insulins stimulation data obtained before and after an hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in subjects living without obesity or stimulation of in vitro differentiated adipocytes (SGBS) with insulin. For the in vivo data, CAGE-sequencing data is available for 19 subjects, for SGBS cells, RNA sequencing data is available for three insulin treated replicates (100 mM) and 12 controls.
