Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were isolated from scWAT of a male donor (aged 16 years, BMI 24 kg/m2). The cells were isolated, propagated, and differentiated to adipocytes using protocols described in detail by Rodriguez et al. (J Exp Med, 2005, PMID: 15867092) and Zaragosi et al. (Stem Cells, 2006, PMID: 16840552). Briefly, stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated by collagenase treatment of scWAT followed by centrifugation. Cells were then selected for their ability to adhere to plastic and proliferated/subcultured in proliferation medium containing 10% FBS and FGF2 (2.5 ng/mL, #F0291, Merck) cultured at 37° C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Three days after confluence, FGF2 was removed from the media (day -1) and differentiation was induced the next day (day 0) using differentiation media (50% DMEM-low glucose with 1% HEPES and 50 I.U./mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin and 50% Ham’s F12 ready to use) which was supplemented with 5 ug/ml insulin, 10 ug/ml transferrin and 0.2 nM T3 for during the complete differentiation, 10 uM rosiglitazone for the first 10 days and 100 uM IBMX and 1 uM dexamethasone for the first 3 days.
