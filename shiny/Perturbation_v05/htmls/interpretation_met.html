    The first tab visualizes the transcriptome data obtained by RNA seq analysis of Metformin treated adipocytes in a <b>heatmap</b>. 
    Hereby either the absolute abundance across included individuals (allowing comparison across genes) or the z-score normalized mean abundance (default, allows comparison across cell types for multiple genes) can be shown. 
    Clustering, as well as colorization, can be changed under <b>Customization</b> in the left sidebar. The <b>Volcano</b> tab shows all available data points, highlighting and labeling the provided genes of interest. 
    This facilitates a comparison to the complete data set. The <b>Table</b> tab allows to download the results of the visualized data.
