For this data set on ex vivo differentiation of isolated fibroblasts the stroma vascular fraction of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue from four individuals was obtained by collagenase digestion. Cells were differentiated as detailed in the “Details” section, and RNA was collected at 4, 8 and 12 days after differentiation. Transcript information was obtained by CAGE sequencing. Isolated adipocytes from the same subjects serve as control samples.
