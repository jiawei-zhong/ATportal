The stroma vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated after collagenase digestion of scWAT and was suspended in FCS supplemented with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. Upon analysis, the SVF of scWAT was thawed, washed with PBS-0.5% BSA-2 mmol/l EDTA buffer (BSA A4503; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and passed through a 70 ??m cell mesh (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Subsequently, the SVF was stained for 30 min at 4°C with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (anti-CD45 (HI30), Alexa Fluor® 700; anti-CD34 (563), PE-CF594; anti-CD31 (WM59),FITC; anti-CD3 (SK7), Brilliant Violet (BV) 786; anti-CD4 (RPA-T4), BV605; anti-CD8 (SK1), APC-H7; anti-CD11c (B-ly6), PE-CyT7; anti-CD14 (M??P9), BV711;anti-CD19 (SJ25C1), BV650; anti-CD25 (M-A251), BV421; anti-CD127 (HIL-7R-M21), Alexa Fluor® 647; anti-CD206 (19.2), PE. All antibodies were from BD Biosciences.) in 50 ??l BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences). After staining, cells were washed, filtered again and re-suspended in PBS-0.1% BSA-2 mmol/l EDTA buffer. Viability of the cells was assessed using 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) dye (BD Biosciences), which was added to the samples 15 min before the sorting procedure and constituted a 13th color in the FACS sorting. Freezing did not affect the viability or frequency of SVF cell fractions. Cells were sorted using a FACSAria III equipped with 488 nm, 633 nm, 405 nm and 561 nm lasers and the Diva software (BD Biosciences). The purity of the sorted population was confirmed to be typically >95% by post-sort analysis. The viability of the cells was typically 75%-85%. The viability of the SVF cells was very low in one patient (25%) and thus cytometry data obtained in this sample was excluded from analysis. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo version 10.0.7.2 software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).. RNA was prepared from eight different cell WAT cell types (ASCs, total adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), M1 ATMs, M2 ATMs, total T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and mature adipocytes). Ten nanograms of RNA was amplified using four cycles and loaded onto ClariomTD microarray chips.
