In this data set Acosta et al. isolated subcutaneous adipose tissue from 6 women (see Details) and performed collagenase digest to separate adipocytes and stroma vascular fraction (SVF). Subsequent FACS sorting allowed the generation of adipose tissue and cell type specific gene expression data for major cell classes including T cells, M1 and M2 macrophages, endothelial cells using Clariom D microarrays.
