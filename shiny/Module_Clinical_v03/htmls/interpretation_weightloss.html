All data is presented as boxplots with individual, paired data points connected by lines. The p-value is indicated depending on the chosen statistical test in Input (default = paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Any combination of genes and/or traits is accepted as inputs, e.g., to visualize the BMI changes across follow-up time points, leave the Gene field empty and select BMI under Trait. The table tab allows the extraction of mean abundance values for all timepoints, selected cohorts and genes/traits.
