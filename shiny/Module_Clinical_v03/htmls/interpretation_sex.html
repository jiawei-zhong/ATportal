When only one cohort is selected, statistical test for mean (Student’s t-test) or median (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, default) comparison can be chosen. The output will generate boxplot comparisons for each gene in the Input field, with the exact p value being indicated. Boxplots show the interquartile range with Tukey’s whiskers and all individual datapoints are shown. Mean values can be extracted from the Table tab.
Inputting multiple cohorts but only one gene allows the generation of meta-analysis forest plots highlighting standard mean difference and the respective 95% confidence interval for each cohort. Weighted average standard mean difference is calculated according to the common or random effects model, and the respective statistics should be chosen based on the heterogeneity testing below the plot.
If multiple cohorts and multiple genes are selected, the output will be a heatmap, showing the logarithmic  fold change for every possible combination. Significant values after FDR-adjustment are indicated by asterisks, whereby: &#42;&#42;&#42; p<sub>FDR</sub>	&#60;0.001, &#42;&#42; p<sub>FDR</sub>	&#60; 0.01, &#42; p<sub>FDR</sub>	&#60; 0.05 .
