This module currently contains five data sets which are briefly explained here. 
<br> <br>
<b><u>Kerr, A. et al. (2020)</u></b> <br>
Description:<br>

Publication: ” Long-term changes in adipose tissue gene expression following bariatric surgery”, PMID: 32406570<br>
<br><br>
<b><u>Petrus, P. et al. (2018)</u></b><br>
Description: This publication includes 16 women living with obesity investigated before and two years after bariatric surgery. All women attained a post-operative body mass index &#60; 30 kg/m2 and for each post-obese subject, a woman who had never been obese was recruited and matched for age and current BMI. From all participants, subcutaneous abdominal white adipose tissue biopsies were obtained and investigated by gene microarray.
<br>
Publication: “Transforming Growth Factor-β3 Regulates Adipocyte Number in Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue”, PMID: 30332637<br>
<br><br>
<b><u>Imbert, A. et al. (2022)</u></b><br>
Description: Imbert et al. sequenced subcutaneous white adipose tissue samples of 556 individuals that were enrolled in an 8-week low-caloric weight loss diet study (DiOGenes) using QuantSeq sequencing. The DiOGenes study is a pan-European, multicenter study that was originally described by Larsen et al. (N Engl J Med., 2010;363(22): 2102-2113.). Samples were collected from the abdomen by needle aspiration from about 10 cm from the umbilicus. 
<br>
Publication: “Network Analyses Reveal Negative Link Between Changes in Adipose Tissue GDF15 and BMI During Dietary-induced Weight Loss”, PMID: 34415992, clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT00390637
<br><br>
<b><u>Armenise, C. et al. (2017)</u></b><br>
Description: This publication is part of the DiOGenes cohort, a pan-European, multicenter, randomized controlled dietary intervention program (Larsen et al., N Engl J Med., 2010;363(22): 2102-2113.). After quality-filtering, the authors analyzed transcriptome data of 191 subjects with obesity but without diabetes. All subjects underwent an 8-week low-caloric weight loss diet.
<br>
Publication: “Transcriptome profiling from adipose tissue during a low-calorie diet reveals predictors of weight and glycemic outcomes in obese, nondiabetic subjects”, PMID: 28793995, clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT00390637
<br><br>
<b><u>Vink, RG. (2017)</u></b><br>
Description: For this study on moderate weight loss using a low-caloric (1250 kcal per day for 12 weeks) or very low-caloric diet (500 kcal per day for five weeks), the authors collected abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from 25 male and 28 female subjects. Transcriptome data was obtained using human whole-genome Affymetrix Gene 1.1 ST arrays.<br>
Publication: “Adipose tissue gene expression is differentially regulated with different rates of weight loss in overweight and obese humans”, PMID: 27840413
