    The first tab (<b>Spatial Feature Plot</b>) visualizes either gene expression or the abundance of a cell type across a given slide. To use this feature, please select either a Gene or Cell Type in the Input panel. Depending on the dataset, multiple patients may be included; these can be selected under the "Slide" option in the Input panel. For more information about Spatial Feature Plots, refer to the <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/spatialplot">Seurat documentation</a>.
<br>
The next tab (<b>Feature Plot</b>) displays "classical" UMAPs, as shown in the original manuscripts. Both Gene expression and Cell Type deconvolution scores can be highlighted. Due to the nature of Visium spatial transcriptomics data—where transcriptome information is derived from a 55µm spot—the data represents a mix of different cell types. Without deconvolution, only the dominant cell type can be annotated.  
<br>
The <b>Violin Plot</b> tab summarizes the same information in violin plots. All cluster-specific marker genes can be downloaded from the <b>Marker Genes</b> tab.
