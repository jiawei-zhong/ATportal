    This module allows the exploration of gene expression and presence of cell types across human subcutaneous white adipose tissue sections. Currently, the module contains data published by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34380013/">B&#228;ckdahl et al.</a>, which was generated using the Visium method (10X Genomics). Cell type distribution was calculated using <a href="https://github.com/BayraktarLab/cell2location">cell2location</a> and using data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36922516/">Massier et al.</a>. More information can be found in the <b>Details</b> and <b>Interpretation</b> tabs below.
