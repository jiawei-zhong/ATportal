# How to use and navigate the Adipose Tissue Knowledge Portal

## Gene Summary

The easiest way to use the AT portal, is to enter a gene name into the search bar on the [starting page](adiposetissue.org). This will open the Gene Summary Module (which has the same search bar), and provide a comprehensive overview across all available modules.
